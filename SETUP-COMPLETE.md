## 🎨 Quick Customization Tips

### Edit World Content
Update individual pages in `/app/worlds/[world-name]/page.tsx`

### Adjust Rolodex Animation
In `components/Rolodex.tsx`:
- `ANGLES`: Change the fan spread (currently ~120°)
- `SPRING`: Adjust animation feel (stiffness, damping, mass)
- `OPEN_DELAY`: Delay before fan opens (currently 150ms)

### Add New Worlds
1. Add to `data/cards.ts`
2. Create page at `app/worlds/[slug]/page.tsx`
3. Update navigation as needed
